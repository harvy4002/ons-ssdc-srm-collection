  # When active, APPLY_FIXES must also be defined as environment variable

  # This is dynamically set based on the presence of the PAT secret.
  # If the PAT secret is not present, the APPLY_FIXES environment variable is set to none.
  # Without a PAT token, commits/PRs will not trigger workflow runs.
  # This is a GitHub Actions limitation to prevent infinite loops.
